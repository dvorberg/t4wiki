# t4wiki
This wants to be a Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL based Wiki software with support for various markup languages, and a language-aware full text search with weighted results.

This project will function as my own wiki and is meant to contain some 1200 legacy documents. If it does the above with those documents plus the ones I’m currently working on, I’m done. My motivation to make things easily accessible for others may vary; just so you know.
